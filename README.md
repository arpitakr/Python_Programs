# Basic Python Programs
Welcome to my collection of basic level Python programs! This collection is designed to help me learn and practice fundamental Python programming concepts.

# Introduction
This repository contains various simple Python programs that cover essential programming concepts. The aim is to provide a hands-on approach to learning Python, making it easier to understand and apply basic programming principles.

# Getting Started
To get started with these Python programs, I need to have Python installed on my computer. If I don't have Python installed, I can download and install it from Python's official website.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository to my local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-python-programs.git

3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
   cd basic-python-programs

# How to Run
To run any of the programs, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the program I want to run.

3. Execute the program using Python:
   python program_name.py
   
5. Replace program_name.py with the actual name of the file I want to run.
   
7. Commit the changes:
   git commit -m "Add feature-name"

8. Push to the branch:
   git push origin feature-name

Happy coding! If I have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
